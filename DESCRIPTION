Description: R wrapper around Ark-TweetNLP's Twitter POS tagger by Kevin Gimpel et al. (2011) <https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P11-2008>. Can be used to POS tag tweets in R, returning a dataframe with the columns of word, tag, and confidence. A download function is also included, with which both the required standard model and additional models can be installed directly in R (e.g. the "penn" model returns the tags in the Penn Treebank style).
